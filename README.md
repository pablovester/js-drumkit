# VANILLA JS DRUMKIT

---

## INSTRUCTIONS

Just type the letters that you see on the screen to produce the desired sound. Have fun! 

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

I created this drumkit as a result of lesson 1 of *[JavaScript30]* (https://javascript30.com/), in order to put my JS knowledge to test - and practice.

Although it is a very small and simple thing, I feel very proud of it. It is an entertaining project and fully functional, too.

It was coded in *ES6* as you can see from this repository and for now it works on desktop. Hopefully I can make it work on mobile later on and maybe add some more functionalities to it. Suggestions are welcome!
